    ðŸ”„ HYBRID ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
    This class supports both dependency injection AND direct function calls.

    - Unit Tests: Use TaskService(storage=None) â†’ calls load_tasks()/save_tasks() directly
    - Integration: Use TaskService(task_storage) â†’ calls injected storage.load_tasks()/save_tasks()

    ðŸ“‹ NEXT LAB: Once everything works, we'll clean this up to use ONLY dependency injection
    for cleaner, more maintainable code. This hybrid approach is temporary for learning!
